## Description

This repository contains docker configuration to build bootable iso
image with [Linux From Scratch 8.2](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/downloads/8.2/LFS-BOOK-8.2.pdf).


## Status

At the moment, I don't have plans to update scripts to the latest LFS versions. However, pull requests are welcomed.

## Why

General idea is to learn Linux by building and running LFS system in
isolation from the host system.

## Structure

Scripts are organized in the way of following book structure whenever
it makes sense. Some deviations are done to make a bootable iso image.

## Build

Use the following command:

    docker rm lfs                                       && \
    docker build --tag lfs:8.2 .                        && \
    sudo docker run -it --privileged --name lfs lfs:8.2 && \
    sudo docker cp lfs:/tmp/lfs.iso .
    # Ramdisk you can find here: /tmp/ramdisk.img

Please note, that extended privileges are required by docker container
in order to execute some commands (e.g. mount).

## Usage

Final result is bootable iso image with LFS system which, for
example, can be used to load the system inside virtual machine (tested
with VirtualBox).

## Troubleshooting

If you have problems with master branch, please try to use stable version from the latest release with toolchain from archive.
